This project analyzes NYRR race data for the Crown Height Running Club.  

The project uses Pandas and Matplotlib to read and compile CSV data files and then plot results.  Data from club races throughout the 2017 season are loaded into one dataframe.  In addition to the fields provided by NYRR, I added fields for race distance and for predicted 10K pace (which allows pace comparison across race distances). The dataframe can be grouped by runner, race distance, race, or other factors. At present, the data can be used to show the spread of paces in the club, changes in pace ranges by race, and changes in a runnerâ€™s pace over the season.
